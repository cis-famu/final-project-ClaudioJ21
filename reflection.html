    <p> As to this reflection, the semester has come to an end, and with that I want to mention what I've learned over this period. I have become better at designing and being more creative and more able to use critical thinking. I have also acquired the ability to use HTML as a coding language, since I have been challenged to explore this language with the corresponding CSS and add ons that this language comes with. This will help me in the future because I want to dedicate myself to coding, and this knowledge is definitely a good addition to my goals in life, as it can also help me during my daily activites. I also think my critical thinking has improved a lot, making these abilities a lot more useful since I can look into the situations that I can use this for and make the situations easier.</p>
